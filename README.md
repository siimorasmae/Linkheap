## Linkheap

[Linkheap](http://pixeltouch.ee/projects/linkheap/) takes an RSS feed from [readability.com](http://www.readability.com) (using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org), [JSON](http://www.json.org) and [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/)) and makes it pretty with HTML and CSS. It also uses [Readability's API](http://www.readability.com/developers/api) to format each individual article for, uh.. readability. That's pretty much it.

Made to get an overview of AngularJS.
